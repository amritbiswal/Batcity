# GitHub Copilot Instructions — Batman Runner Game
# ------------------------------------------------
# This project is a lightweight 2-phase browser game built with:
#   - Pure HTML
#   - Pure CSS
#   - Pure vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation only)
# No Canvas, no frameworks, no libraries, no build tools.

# View / Screen Requirements
# --------------------------
# The game is a single-page app using ONE index.html containing THREE views:
#   1. Start View
#   2. Game View
#   3. End View
#
# Start View:
#   - Visible when the page loads or after restart.
#   - Must include:
#       * Game title (Batman Runner)
#       * Short description of the game
#       * Controls for DESKTOP (keys) and MOBILE (buttons)
#       * A clear "Start" button
#   - When Start is pressed:
#       * Switch to Game View
#       * Initialize/reset game state
#
# Game View:
#   - Contains the actual game container:
#       * Scrolling background
#       * Ground
#       * Player (Batman on Batmobile)
#       * HUD (score, phase, Joker HP in phase 2)
#       * Mobile controls (Jump / Shoot buttons)
#   - Visible only during active gameplay.
#
# End View:
#   - Shown after Game Over or Victory.
#   - Must show:
#       * End message (lose / win)
#       * Final score
#       * Optional high score
#       * Button to go back to Start View (and/or Restart Game)
#   - Implemented by hiding Game View and showing End View elements.
#
# Views should be toggled using CSS classes (e.g. hidden) or style changes,
# NOT by navigating to separate HTML pages.

# Gameplay Requirements
# ---------------------
# PHASE 1 (Runner)
# - Scrolling background (CSS animation)
# - Batman in a Batmobile (DOM element)
# - Player actions: jump + shoot
# - Entities spawn from right → left:
#     - obstacles
#     - enemies
#     - civilians
# - Scoring:
#     - + time-based score
#     - +3 per enemy shot
#     - +5 per civilian saved
# - Game Over conditions:
#     - hit obstacle/enemy
#     - shoot civilian
# - Transition to PHASE 2 when score >= 50

# PHASE 2 (Boss Fight)
# - Background stops scrolling
# - Joker appears on right
# - Joker shoots periodically
# - Player can jump + shoot
# - Joker starts with 10 HP
# - Game Over if Joker bullet hits player
# - Win if Joker HP reaches 0

# Responsiveness Requirements
# ---------------------------
# - Game must work on all screens (desktop, tablet, mobile)
# - Use % / vh / vw / clamp() sizing
# - Game dimensions must be computed dynamically from the game container
# - Entities must scale with screen size
#
# Mobile Controls:
#   - On small screens, show on-screen buttons:
#       * Jump button
#       * Shoot button
#   - Buttons must support click + touchstart
#
# Desktop Controls:
#   - Space / ArrowUp -> Jump
#   - F / S -> Shoot

# Development Preferences
# -----------------------
# - Use clean, readable code and good naming
# - Keep logic modular and maintainable
# - Use comments to explain tricky or important logic
# - Use requestAnimationFrame for the game loop
# - Use DOM elements for entities (divs with classes)
# - Use getBoundingClientRect() for collision detection
# - Keep keyboard + touch controls unified
# - Make all movement time-based and responsive to container size
# - Avoid global sprawl; group related logic

# What Copilot Should Generate
# ----------------------------
# - HTML structure with three views: Start, Game, End (toggle via CSS/JS)
# - CSS for layout, animations, responsiveness, and view switching
# - JS game logic for both phases (spawning, physics, collision, transitions)
# - JS for view transitions (Start -> Game -> End -> Start)
# - Clean helper functions and modular structure
# - Optional extensions:
#     * sprite usage
#     * audio effects
#     * localStorage high score
#     * difficulty scaling
#     * pause system
#
# Always preserve:
#   * Pure HTML/CSS/JS (DOM only)
#   * Two-phase gameplay
#   * Three views (Start / Game / End) in one index.html
#   * Full responsiveness
#   * Mobile controls
